### Foot Fatigue Index Model
This project simulates a Foot Fatigue Index that quantifies how physically fatigued a workerâ€™s feet become based on their job, shoes, posture, age, and weight. It was built as part of a data science challenge from Hike Medical, focused on real-world ergonomic risk modeling.
